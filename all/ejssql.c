**
** SQLite can be compiled with or without mutexes.  When

** are enabled and SQLite is threadsafe.  When the
** [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro is 0, 
** the mutexes are omitted.  Without the mutexes, it is not safe
** to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.
**
** Enabling mutexes incurs a measurable performance penalty.

** the mutexes.  But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
** The default behavior is for mutexes to be enabled.
**
** This interface can be used by a program to make sure that the
** version of SQLite that it is linking against was compiled with
** the desired setting of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro.
**
** This interface only reports on the compile-time mutex setting
** of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] flag.  If SQLite is compiled with
** SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 then mutexes are enabled by default but
** can be fully or partially disabled using a call to [sqlite3_config()]
** with the verbs [SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD], [SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD],
** or [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX].  The return value of this function shows

** SQL statements are passed in as the second parameter to sqlite3_exec().
** The statements are evaluated one by one until either an error or

** results produced by the SQL statements.  The 5th parameter tells where
** to write any error messages.

** in memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  To avoid a memory leak,
** the calling application should call [sqlite3_free()] on any error
** message returned through the 5th parameter when it has finished using
** the error message.
**

** or a string containing only whitespace and comments, then no SQL
** statements are evaluated and the database is not changed.

**
** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs] xOpen method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the xOpen method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element 
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the xOpen reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed xOpen
** is for the xOpen to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]

** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC64K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
** are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of

** that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
** way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
** information is written to disk in the same order as calls
** to xWrite().
**
** If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object {H11140} <S20100>
**
** An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
** the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".
**
** The value of the iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger in
** future versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
** object when the iVersion value is increased.  Note that the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between
** SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not
** modified.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname().  SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentence,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter is xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invent its own temporary name for the file.  Whenever the 
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. 
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** </ul>
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP  databases, journals and for subjournals.
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
** analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
** API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the 
** SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
** be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
** It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened 
** for exclusive access.
**
** At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
** the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
** a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
** this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
** element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
** or failure of the xOpen call.
**
** The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
** directory.
**
** SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), and xCurrentTime() interfaces
** are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time.

**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
** SQLite library.  The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.
**
** A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
** call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  Only
** an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
** All other calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.
**
** Among other things, sqlite3_initialize() shall invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, sqlite3_shutdown()
** shall invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for unix, windows, or os/2.
** When built for other platforms (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time

** Note that SQLite comes with a built-in memory allocator that is
** perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xFree, and xRealloc methods must work like the
** malloc(), free(), and realloc() functions from the standard library.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  (For example,
** it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to

** page cache memory is needed beyond what is provided by this option, then
** SQLite goes to [sqlite3_malloc()] for the additional storage space.

** an attempt is made to open a database table that another thread
** or process has locked.
**
** If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock. If the busy callback
** is not NULL, then the callback will be invoked with two arguments.
**
** The first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to sqlite3_busy_handler().  The second argument to
** the handler callback is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event.  If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] is returned.
** If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to open the database for reading and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that it will be invoked
** when there is lock contention. If SQLite determines that invoking the busy
** handler could result in a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] instead of invoking the busy handler.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** The [SQLITE_BUSY] error is converted to [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** when SQLite is in the middle of a large transaction where all the
** changes will not fit into the in-memory cache.  SQLite will
** already hold a RESERVED lock on the database file, but it needs
** to promote this lock to EXCLUSIVE so that it can spill cache
** pages into the database file without harm to concurrent
** readers.  If it is unable to promote the lock, then the in-memory
** cache will be left in an inconsistent state and so the error
** code is promoted from the relatively benign [SQLITE_BUSY] to
** the more severe [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED].  This error code promotion
** forces an automatic rollback of the changes.  See the
** <a href="/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">
** CorruptionFollowingBusyError</a> wiki page for a discussion of why
** this is important.
**
** There can only be a single busy handler defined for each
** [database connection].  Setting a new busy handler clears any
** previously set handler.  Note that calling [sqlite3_busy_timeout()]
** will also set or clear the busy handler.

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries {H12370} <S10000>
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the

** The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more

**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should

** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions {H17400} <S70000><S20000>
**
** These routines are workalikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].  Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** In sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes) in place of the %Q option.  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** The "%z" formatting option works exactly like "%s" with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string. {END}

** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem {H17300} <S20000>
**
** The SQLite core  uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific VFS implementation.  The
** Windows VFS uses native malloc() and free() for some operations.
**
** The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
**
** The sqlite3_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the
** second parameter.  The memory allocation to be resized is the first
** parameter.  If the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc()
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N) where N is the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** If the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** sqlite3_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc() and the prior allocation is freed.
** If sqlite3_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation
** is not freed.
**
** The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc() and sqlite3_realloc()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary. {END}
**
** The default implementation of the memory allocation subsystem uses
** the malloc(), realloc() and free() provided by the standard C library.
** {H17382} However, if SQLite is compiled with the
** SQLITE_MEMORY_SIZE=<i>NNN</i> C preprocessor macro (where <i>NNN</i>
** is an integer), then SQLite create a static array of at least
** <i>NNN</i> bytes in size and uses that array for all of its dynamic

** may be added in future releases.
**
** In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define
** the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION which would cause the built-in
** implementation of these routines to be omitted.  That capability
** is no longer provided.  Only built-in memory allocators can be used.
**
** The Windows OS interface layer calls
** the system malloc() and free() directly when converting

** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Authorization Callbacks {H12500} <S70100>
**
** This routine registers a authorizer callback with a particular
** [database connection], supplied in the first argument.
** The authorizer callback is invoked as SQL statements are being compiled
** by [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants [sqlite3_prepare_v2()],
** [sqlite3_prepare16()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()].  At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then the [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied. 
**
** The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.  Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be reprepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a 
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
**
** Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement {H13010} <S10000>
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum
** number of  bytes read from zSql.  When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes.
**
** If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** *ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned, otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave a differently in two ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again.  If the schema has changed in
** a way that makes the statement no longer valid, [sqlite3_step()] will still
** return [SQLITE_SCHEMA].  But unlike the legacy behavior, [SQLITE_SCHEMA] is
** now a fatal error.  Calling [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] again will not make the
** error go away.  Note: use [sqlite3_errmsg()] to find the text
** of the parsing error that results in an [SQLITE_SCHEMA] return.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and you would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()] in order
** to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
** </li>
** </ol>

**
** SQLite uses the sqlite3_value object to represent all values
** that can be stored in a database table. SQLite uses dynamic typing
** for the values it stores. Values stored in sqlite3_value objects
** can be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.

** Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  A internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with [SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0] and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** or if SQLite is run in one of reduced mutex modes

** <li>  ?NNN
** <li>  :VVV
** <li>  @VVV
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the parameter forms shown above NNN is an integer literal,
** and VVV is an alpha-numeric parameter name. The values of these
** parameters (also called "host parameter names" or "SQL parameters")
** can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines is always
** a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants.
**
** The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
** The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  When the same named
** SQL parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
** The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite3_bind_parameter_index()] API if desired.  The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite3_limit()]
** parameter [SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 999).
**
** The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the
** number of bytes in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the
** number of <u>bytes</u> in the value, not the number of characters.
** If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** the number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
**
** The fifth argument to sqlite3_bind_blob(), sqlite3_bind_text(), and
** sqlite3_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** string after SQLite has finished with it. If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeroes.  A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold its size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as placeholders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using
** [sqlite3_blob_open | incremental BLOB I/O] routines.
** A negative value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_*() routines must be called after
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] (and its variants) or [sqlite3_reset()] and
** before [sqlite3_step()].
** Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
** Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
**
** These routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an error code if
** anything goes wrong.  [SQLITE_RANGE] is returned if the parameter
** index is out of range.  [SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc() fails.
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] might be returned if these routines are called on a
** virtual machine that is the wrong state or which has already been finalized.
** Detection of misuse is unreliable.  Applications should not depend
** on SQLITE_MISUSE returns.  SQLITE_MISUSE is intended to indicate a
** a logic error in the application.  Future versions of SQLite might
** panic rather than return SQLITE_MISUSE.

** CAPI3REF: Evaluate An SQL Statement {H13200} <S10000>
**
** After a [prepared statement] has been prepared using either
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or one of the legacy
** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()], this function
** must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of the sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY],
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** [SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within a
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** [SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** [SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()
** API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,
** then the more specific [error codes] are returned directly

** CAPI3REF: Result Values From A Query {H13800} <S10700>
** KEYWORDS: {column access functions}
**
** These routines form the "result set query" interface.
**
** These routines return information about a single column of the current
** result row of a query.  In every case the first argument is a pointer
** to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
** that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
** and the second argument is the index of the column for which information
** should be returned.  The leftmost column of the result set has the index 0.
**
** If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** The value returned does not include the zero terminator at the end
** of the string.  For clarity: the value returned is the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero terminated.  The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is an arbitrary
** pointer, possibly even a NULL pointer.
**
** The sqlite3_column_bytes16() routine is similar to sqlite3_column_bytes()
** but leaves the result in UTF-16 in native byte order instead of UTF-8.
** The zero terminator is not included in this count.
**
** The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  An unprotected sqlite3_value object
** may only be used with [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], then the behavior is undefined.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
** conversion automatically.  The following table details the conversions
** that are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal<br>Type <th> Requested<br>Type <th>  Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert from float to integer
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as FLOAT->TEXT
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td> INTEGER   <td> Use atoi()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Use atof()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>   BLOB    <td> No change
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert to TEXT then use atoi()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert to TEXT then use atof()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>
**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** own equivalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer points to will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
** sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  The memory space used to hold strings
** and BLOBs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return
** [SQLITE_NOMEM].

** KEYWORDS: {function creation routines}
** KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL function}
** KEYWORDS: {application-defined SQL functions}
**
** These two functions (collectively known as "function creation routines")
** are used to add SQL functions or aggregates or to redefine the behavior
** of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The only difference between the
** two is that the second parameter, the name of the (scalar) function or
** aggregate, is encoded in UTF-8 for sqlite3_create_function() and UTF-16
** for sqlite3_create_function16().
**
** The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
** function is to be added.  If a single program uses more than one database
** connection internally, then SQL functions must be added individually to
** each database connection.
**
** The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created or
** redefined.  The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes, exclusive of
** the zero-terminator.  Note that the name length limit is in bytes, not
** characters.  Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in [SQLITE_ERROR] being returned.
**
** The third parameter (nArg)
** is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. If this parameter is -1, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments between 0 and the limit
** set by [sqlite3_limit]([SQLITE_LIMIT_FUNCTION_ARG]).  If the third
** parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is
** undefined.
**
** The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  Any SQL function implementation should be able to work
** work with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  It is allowed to
** invoke sqlite3_create_function() or sqlite3_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
** If there is only a single implementation which does not care what text
** encoding is used, then the fourth argument should be [SQLITE_ANY].
**
** The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
** function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite3_user_data()].
**
** The seventh, eighth and ninth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
** aggregate. A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
** callback only, NULL pointers should be passed as the xStep and xFinal
** parameters. An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL should be passed for xFunc. To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL for all three function callbacks.
**
** It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  SQLite will use
** the implementation most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.  A function implementation with a non-negative
** nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
** a negative nArg.  A function where the preferred text encoding
** matches the database encoding is a better
** match than a function where the encoding is different.  
** A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
** is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
** between UTF8 and UTF16.
**
** Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
** The first application-defined function with a given name overrides all
** built-in functions in the same [database connection] with the same name.
** Subsequent application-defined functions of the same name only override 
** prior application-defined functions that are an exact match for the
** number of parameters and preferred encoding.
**
** An application-defined function is permitted to call other
** SQLite interfaces.  However, such calls must not
** close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared
** statement in which the function is running.

** CAPI3REF: Obtaining SQL Function Parameter Values {H15100} <S20200>
**
** The C-language implementation of SQL functions and aggregates uses
** this set of interface routines to access the parameter values on
** the function or aggregate.
**
** The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
** The 4th parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
** each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
** extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** object results in undefined behavior.
**
** These routines work just like the corresponding [column access functions]
** except that  these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object
** pointer instead of a [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF-16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF-16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**
** The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
** numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words, if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is performed.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.
** The [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.
**
** Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer returned
** from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or
** [sqlite3_value_text16()] can be invalidated by a subsequent call to
** [sqlite3_value_bytes()], [sqlite3_value_bytes16()], [sqlite3_value_text()],

**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that

** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of
** functions used to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
**
** The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() interfaces set the result of
** the application-defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF-16 in native
** byte order.  If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** The sqlite3_result_toobig() interface causes SQLite to throw an error
** indicating that a string or BLOB is to long to represent.
**
** The sqlite3_result_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an error
** indicating that a memory allocation failed.
**
** The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_null() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter
** through the first zero character.
** If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or BLOB result when it has
** finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or
** sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then SQLite
** assumes that the text or BLOB result is in constant space and does not
** copy the it or call a destructor when it has finished using that result.
** If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_TRANSIENT
** then SQLite makes a copy of the result into space obtained from
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] before it returns.
**
** The sqlite3_result_value() interface sets the result of
** the application-defined function to be a copy the
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object specified by the 2nd parameter.  The
** sqlite3_result_value() interface makes a copy of the [sqlite3_value]
** so that the [sqlite3_value] specified in the parameter may change or
** be deallocated after sqlite3_result_value() returns without harm.
** A [protected sqlite3_value] object may always be used where an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object is required, so either
** kind of [sqlite3_value] object can be used with this interface.

**
** If the flags parameter is non-zero, then the BLOB is opened for read
** and write access. If it is zero, the BLOB is opened for read access.
**
** Note that the database name is not the filename that contains
** the database but rather the symbolic name of the database that
** is assigned when the database is connected using [ATTACH].
** For the main database file, the database name is "main".
** For TEMP tables, the database name is "temp".
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned and the new [BLOB handle] is written
** to *ppBlob. Otherwise an [error code] is returned and *ppBlob is set
** to be a null pointer.
** This function sets the [database connection] error code and message
** accessible via [sqlite3_errcode()] and [sqlite3_errmsg()] and related
** functions.  Note that the *ppBlob variable is always initialized in a
** way that makes it safe to invoke [sqlite3_blob_close()] on *ppBlob
** regardless of the success or failure of this routine.
**
** If the row that a BLOB handle points to is modified by an
** [UPDATE], [DELETE], or by [ON CONFLICT] side-effects
** then the BLOB handle is marked as "expired".
** This is true if any column of the row is changed, even a column
** other than the one the BLOB handle is open on.
** Calls to [sqlite3_blob_read()] and [sqlite3_blob_write()] for
** a expired BLOB handle fail with an return code of [SQLITE_ABORT].
** Changes written into a BLOB prior to the BLOB expiring are not
** rollback by the expiration of the BLOB.  Such changes will eventually
** commit if the transaction continues to completion.
**
** Use the [sqlite3_blob_bytes()] interface to determine the size of

** CAPI3REF: Mutexes {H17000} <S20000>
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization. Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in
** a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2,
** SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD, and SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations
** are appropriate for use on OS/2, Unix, and Windows.
**
** If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library. In this case the
** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
** function that calls sqlite3_initialize().
**
** {H17011} The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. {H17012} If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated. {H17013} SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error. {H17014} The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul>
**
** {H17015} The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used. {END}
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  {H17016} But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  {END} If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** {H17017} The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex. {END}  Four static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** {H17018} Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  {H17034} But for the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** {H17019} The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex. {H17020} SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates. {A17021} The dynamic mutexes must not be in
** use when they are deallocated. {A17022} Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior. {H17023} SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex. {END}
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex. {H17024} If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY. {H17025}  The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  {H17026} Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** {H17027} In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.  {A17028} If the same thread tries to enter any other
** kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
** {H17029} SQLite will never exhibit
** such behavior in its own use of mutexes.
**
** Some systems (for example, Windows 95) do not support the operation
** implemented by sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try()
** will always return SQLITE_BUSY.  {H17030} The SQLite core only ever uses
** sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable behavior.
**
** {H17031} The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.  {A17032} The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the
** calling thread or is not currently allocated.  {H17033} SQLite will
** never do either. {END}

/*
** CAPI3REF: Application Defined Page Cache.
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an 
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods structure. The majority of the 
** heap memory used by sqlite is used by the page cache to cache data read 
** from, or ready to be written to, the database file. By implementing a 
** custom page cache using this API, an application can control more 
** precisely the amount of memory consumed by sqlite, the way in which 
** said memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to 
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for 
** how long.
**
** The contents of the structure are copied to an internal buffer by sqlite
** within the call to [sqlite3_config].
**
** The xInit() method is called once for each call to [sqlite3_initialize()]
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). It is passed
** a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods.pArg value. It can be used to set
** up global structures and mutexes required by the custom page cache 
** implementation. The xShutdown() method is called from within 
** [sqlite3_shutdown()], if the application invokes this API. It can be used
** to clean up any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
**
** The xCreate() method is used to construct a new cache instance. The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache. szPage will not be a power of two. The
** second argument, bPurgeable, is true if the cache being created will
** be used to cache database pages read from a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based on the value of bPurgeable,
** it is purely advisory. 
**
** The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command. As with the bPurgeable parameter,
** the implementation is not required to do anything special with this
** value, it is advisory only.
**
** The xPagecount() method should return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache supplied as an argument.
** 
** The xFetch() method is used to fetch a page and return a pointer to it. 
** A 'page', in this context, is a buffer of szPage bytes aligned at an
** 8-byte boundary. The page to be fetched is determined by the key. The
** mimimum key value is 1. After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page 
** is considered to be pinned.
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then a pointer to
** the cached buffer should be returned with its contents intact. If the
** page is not already in the cache, then the expected behaviour of the
** cache is determined by the value of the createFlag parameter passed
** to xFetch, according to the following table:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
**   <tr><th>createFlag<th>Expected Behaviour
**   <tr><td>0<td>NULL should be returned. No new cache entry is created.
**   <tr><td>1<td>If createFlag is set to 1, this indicates that 
**                SQLite is holding pinned pages that can be unpinned
**                by writing their contents to the database file (a
**                relatively expensive operation). In this situation the
**                cache implementation has two choices: it can return NULL,
**                in which case SQLite will attempt to unpin one or more 
**                pages before re-requesting the same page, or it can
**                allocate a new page and return a pointer to it. If a new
**                page is allocated, then the first sizeof(void*) bytes of
**                it (at least) must be zeroed before it is returned.
**   <tr><td>2<td>If createFlag is set to 2, then SQLite is not holding any
**                pinned pages associated with the specific cache passed
**                as the first argument to xFetch() that can be unpinned. The
**                cache implementation should attempt to allocate a new
**                cache entry and return a pointer to it. Again, the first
**                sizeof(void*) bytes of the page should be zeroed before 
**                it is returned. If the xFetch() method returns NULL when 
**                createFlag==2, SQLite assumes that a memory allocation 
**                failed and returns SQLITE_NOMEM to the user.
** </table>
**
** xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument. If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page should be evicted from the cache. In this case SQLite 
** assumes that the next time the page is retrieved from the cache using
** the xFetch() method, it will be zeroed. If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page is considered to be unpinned. The cache implementation
** may choose to reclaim (free or recycle) unpinned pages at any time.
** SQLite assumes that next time the page is retrieved from the cache
** it will either be zeroed, or contain the same data that it did when it
** was unpinned.
**
** The cache is not required to perform any reference counting. A single 
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls 
** to xFetch().
**
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument from oldKey to newKey. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it should be
** discarded. Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
** All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. After
** calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
** handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods
** functions.

** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** This API is used to overwrite the contents of one database with that
** of another. It is useful either for creating backups of databases or
** for copying in-memory databases to or from persistent files. 
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Online Backup API]
**
** Exclusive access is required to the destination database for the 
** duration of the operation. However the source database is only
** read-locked while it is actually being read, it is not locked
** continuously for the entire operation. Thus, the backup may be
** performed on a live database without preventing other users from
** writing to the database for an extended period of time.
** 
** To perform a backup operation: 
**   <ol>
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b> is called once to initialize the
**         backup, 
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b> is called one or more times to transfer 
**         the data between the two databases, and finally
**     <li><b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b> is called to release all resources 
**         associated with the backup operation. 
**   </ol>
** There should be exactly one call to sqlite3_backup_finish() for each
** successful call to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b>
**
** The first two arguments passed to [sqlite3_backup_init()] are the database
** handle associated with the destination database and the database name 
** used to attach the destination database to the handle. The database name
** is "main" for the main database, "temp" for the temporary database, or
** the name specified as part of the [ATTACH] statement if the destination is
** an attached database. The third and fourth arguments passed to 
** sqlite3_backup_init() identify the [database connection]
** and database name used
** to access the source database. The values passed for the source and 
** destination [database connection] parameters must not be the same.
**
** If an error occurs within sqlite3_backup_init(), then NULL is returned
** and an error code and error message written into the [database connection] 
** passed as the first argument. They may be retrieved using the
** [sqlite3_errcode()], [sqlite3_errmsg()], and [sqlite3_errmsg16()] functions.
** Otherwise, if successful, a pointer to an [sqlite3_backup] object is
** returned. This pointer may be used with the sqlite3_backup_step() and
** sqlite3_backup_finish() functions to perform the specified backup 
** operation.
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b>
**
** Function [sqlite3_backup_step()] is used to copy up to nPage pages between 
** the source and destination databases, where nPage is the value of the 
** second parameter passed to sqlite3_backup_step(). If nPage is a negative
** value, all remaining source pages are copied. If the required pages are 
** succesfully copied, but there are still more pages to copy before the 
** backup is complete, it returns [SQLITE_OK]. If no error occured and there 
** are no more pages to copy, then [SQLITE_DONE] is returned. If an error 
** occurs, then an SQLite error code is returned. As well as [SQLITE_OK] and
** [SQLITE_DONE], a call to sqlite3_backup_step() may return [SQLITE_READONLY],
** [SQLITE_NOMEM], [SQLITE_BUSY], [SQLITE_LOCKED], or an
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX] extended error code.
**
** As well as the case where the destination database file was opened for
** read-only access, sqlite3_backup_step() may return [SQLITE_READONLY] if
** the destination is an in-memory database with a different page size
** from the source database.
**
** If sqlite3_backup_step() cannot obtain a required file-system lock, then
** the [sqlite3_busy_handler | busy-handler function]
** is invoked (if one is specified). If the 
** busy-handler returns non-zero before the lock is available, then 
** [SQLITE_BUSY] is returned to the caller. In this case the call to
** sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later. If the source
** [database connection]
** is being used to write to the source database when sqlite3_backup_step()
** is called, then [SQLITE_LOCKED] is returned immediately. Again, in this
** case the call to sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later on. If
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX], [SQLITE_NOMEM], or
** [SQLITE_READONLY] is returned, then 
** there is no point in retrying the call to sqlite3_backup_step(). These 
** errors are considered fatal. At this point the application must accept 
** that the backup operation has failed and pass the backup operation handle 
** to the sqlite3_backup_finish() to release associated resources.
**
** Following the first call to sqlite3_backup_step(), an exclusive lock is
** obtained on the destination file. It is not released until either 
** sqlite3_backup_finish() is called or the backup operation is complete 
** and sqlite3_backup_step() returns [SQLITE_DONE]. Additionally, each time 
** a call to sqlite3_backup_step() is made a [shared lock] is obtained on
** the source database file. This lock is released before the
** sqlite3_backup_step() call returns. Because the source database is not
** locked between calls to sqlite3_backup_step(), it may be modified mid-way
** through the backup procedure. If the source database is modified by an
** external process or via a database connection other than the one being
** used by the backup operation, then the backup will be transparently
** restarted by the next call to sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source 
** database is modified by the using the same database connection as is used
** by the backup operation, then the backup database is transparently 
** updated at the same time.
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b>
**
** Once sqlite3_backup_step() has returned [SQLITE_DONE], or when the 
** application wishes to abandon the backup operation, the [sqlite3_backup]
** object should be passed to sqlite3_backup_finish(). This releases all
** resources associated with the backup operation. If sqlite3_backup_step()
** has not yet returned [SQLITE_DONE], then any active write-transaction on the
** destination database is rolled back. The [sqlite3_backup] object is invalid
** and may not be used following a call to sqlite3_backup_finish().
**
** The value returned by sqlite3_backup_finish is [SQLITE_OK] if no error
** occurred, regardless or whether or not sqlite3_backup_step() was called
** a sufficient number of times to complete the backup operation. Or, if
** an out-of-memory condition or IO error occured during a call to
** sqlite3_backup_step() then [SQLITE_NOMEM] or an
** [SQLITE_IOERR_ACCESS | SQLITE_IOERR_XXX] error code
** is returned. In this case the error code and an error message are
** written to the destination [database connection].
**
** A return of [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_LOCKED] from sqlite3_backup_step() is
** not a permanent error and does not affect the return value of
** sqlite3_backup_finish().
**
** <b>sqlite3_backup_remaining(), sqlite3_backup_pagecount()</b>
**
** Each call to sqlite3_backup_step() sets two values stored internally
** by an [sqlite3_backup] object. The number of pages still to be backed
** up, which may be queried by sqlite3_backup_remaining(), and the total
** number of pages in the source database file, which may be queried by
** sqlite3_backup_pagecount().
**
** The values returned by these functions are only updated by
** sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source database is modified during a backup
** operation, then the values are not updated to account for any extra
** pages that need to be updated or the size of the source database file
** changing.
**
** <b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b>
**
** The source [database connection] may be used by the application for other
** purposes while a backup operation is underway or being initialized.
** If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
** connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
** from within other threads.
**
** However, the application must guarantee that the destination database
** connection handle is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after 
** sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
** sqlite3_backup_finish(). Unfortunately SQLite does not currently check
** for this, if the application does use the destination [database connection]
** for some other purpose during a backup operation, things may appear to
** work correctly but in fact be subtly malfunctioning.  Use of the
** destination database connection while a backup is in progress might
** also cause a mutex deadlock.
**
** Furthermore, if running in [shared cache mode], the application must
** guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
** is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
** that the application must guarantee that the file-system file being 
** backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
** not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** The [sqlite3_backup] object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple 
** threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
** However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
** APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
** same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
** possible that they return invalid values.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Unlock Notification
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
** This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. After an 
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().
**
** If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is cancelled. The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite3_step() call. If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE_LOCKED.
